# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 02

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-02-001 - Lab Module 02](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974938).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do?

The implementation of the Constrained Device Application (CDA) in Python language serves as a pivotal component within the edge tier, responsible for delivering data of sensors. Its primary role is to connect sensors and client column management through local network. 

How does your implementation work?

A constrained device refers to a computing device with limitations in processing power, memory, energy consumption, and/or network connectivity, such as embedded systems, IoT devices, wearables, and wireless sensor nodes. These devices are specialized for specific functions, often featuring restricted capabilities compared to more robust computing platforms like desktops or servers. Constrained devices pose unique challenges in software development, necessitating optimization techniques and lightweight protocols to ensure efficient operation within their resource constraints. Their small form factors and limited resources demand careful consideration of factors such as power consumption, memory usage, and network bandwidth to maximize performance and longevity while maintaining functionality in diverse application domains.

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)
