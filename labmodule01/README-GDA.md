# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-GDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Lab Module 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 
My implementation create a environment to run the GDA app succesfully. The implementation of the Gateway Device Application (GDA) in Java Eclipse serves as a pivotal component within the gateway device, responsible for managing data, analytics, and configuration settings.

How does your implementation work?
First of all, I have setup the Java environment in Linux (Debian-based, such as Ubuntu 20.04LTS). Then, according to the Chapter 1 of Programming the Internet of Things, I have cloned the code repository for GDA app. After that I verified all sample code, unit / integration tests, and folder structure is the same as the online repo and created branch labmodule01. I worked from the labmodule01 branch then I have merge it with the master branch and push it to the remote repo.

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).


### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)
